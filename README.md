# What is it?
This system is an automated trading system that integrates Binance and Glassnode datasets, implements data preprocessing, does feature extraction, utilizes linear regression for model training, evaluates model performance across various parameters, and enables easy deployment in a live trading environment using Docker. It is something that I hacked together in two weeks since I wanted to learn about ML & MLops.

Live test bot deployed using $25Â balance: http://52.195.167.170/

# Features
1. Automated data scraping from Binance public data-library
2. Support for glassnode datasets by adding glassnode datasets to dir "glassnode_data" in the project root, and the dataset's desired features get automatically added to the final training dataset.
3. Pre-processes the given data: drops unwanted cols, combines datasets, creates desired features, creates train/valid split etc.
4. Automatically begin training the model with the desired features using linear regression.
5. Automatically compare epochs performance on an out-of-sample backtest with different strategy parameters and save the top 5% of performing models.
6. Deploy the automated trading system easily in a live environment using Docker.
